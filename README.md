Signal Modeling and Reconstruction in MRI
Welcome to my research code repository. Although this work is grounded in medical imaging, the techniques implemented here reflect generalizable principles of signal processing, including phased-array signal reconstruction, spatial filtering, and inverse problem modeling. These approaches are directly relevant to applications such as radar imaging, sensor array processing, and beamforming.

Overview
This repository contains GPU-accelerated and CPU-based implementations of:

Phased-array signal reconstruction, including stochastic matched filtering, spatial harmonic decomposition, and low-rank modeling

Bloch simulations for understanding MRI physics and RF signal behavior during acquisition

The code emphasizes physical modeling, time-domain and k-space analysis, and statistical recovery of signal under measurement and aliasing constraints. Several scripts offload computation to the GPU using MATLAB's gpuArray for performance.

uncle_sam_recon/
Code supporting the UNCLE SAM paper (unfolding coil-localized errors via structured matrix modeling).

Includes reconstruction techniques for recovering clean images from aliased or distorted multichannel data.

Relevance to Broader Signal Processing
While this codebase is specific to MRI, the principles are broadly applicable:

Multi-channel signal reconstruction

Beamforming and spatial filtering

Statistical inference from noisy, incomplete measurements

GPU-based acceleration of real-time pipelines

If youâ€™re coming from radar, sonar, or other sensor array domains, you may find this work relevant for signal modeling, simulation, or algorithm development.

Feel free to explore and reach out with questions. This repository is a work in progressâ€”additional reconstructions and simulation demos are being added.
